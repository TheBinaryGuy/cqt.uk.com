                        <p>
                            This regulated one-day training course offers a RQF
                            qualification and a level 2 FAA Award. The course is
                            available face-to-face or online and is accompanied
                            by a course manual.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The course teaches participants to recognise the
                            early signs of suspected mental health conditions
                            and helps participants to build their confidence to
                            offer appropriate and valuable first aid for mental
                            health to people in the workplace and the community.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The course will provide participants with a range of
                            practical tools and techniques to create a
                            supportive climate and lead positive conversations
                            about mental health.
